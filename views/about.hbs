        Hi, Iâ€™m Jinwoo Park, a student at Seneca College, currently enrolled in WEB322.
        I am passionate about web development and eager to learn more about creating
        dynamic web applications using modern technologies like Node.js and Express.
      </p>
      <p>
        This website is part of my journey to build a fully functional eCommerce web
        application. Over the course of this semester, I will be adding more features,
        so stay tuned for updates on new routes and functionalities!
      </p>
      <p>
        In this assignment, I've used HTML, CSS, and the Bootstrap framework to design
        the website, and I've set up a Node.js server using Express to handle requests
        and serve static content.
